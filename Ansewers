3. Describe the workflow of a ChIP-seq experiment (experimental part)

	1: Use formaldehyde to attach all proteins bound to the DNA through covalent cross-links
	2: The use of specific antibody allows us to capture the DNA bound protein of interest.
	3: Then another antibody is used to capture our antiboy with the protein bound and a wash 
  step is performed.
	4: The DNA fragments are sequenced, and the reads will be later processed.

4. Why do we need a control in ChIP-seq experiments?

It's important to have controls. One of the reasons is because open chromatin 
regions are not are not always in the same state and can increase the fasle positive 
rate. Also platajorm-specific sequencing can increase the nonuniformity of the sample.

5.Explain at which stage of a ChIP-seq processing analysis and how we combine 
the information of ChIP and control reads. Describe the output files we get if
we are using the tool MACS2.

At the peak-calling step. In this step we compare the peaks in the Chip files with the 
controls, and we obtain the positions where the histone maks or the TF are bound in the 
genome.
	
The output obtained are wiggle and BED files. If the data is very large we can obtain
binary compressed files called BigWig and BigBed. 
The wiggle files store continuous data of the position and its signal associated
from the comparison done between experiment files vs control files. 
The Bed file contains genomic positions (chr, start and end). Other data can be also obtained.

6. What is a pipeline? In the case of the ENCODE ChIP-seq pipeline, which steps of 
the analysis of ChIP-seq data does it contain?

A pipeline is a sort of different steps or processess with objective to treat inicial objects
(ex: data) and obtain different outputs that can be continusly used until the final produt is
obtained. 
In this case we start with sequenced data in FASTQ files that will be Mapped to obtain BAM files.
Then the peak calling step is performed to obatin the final product: the bigBed and bigWig files.

9. What is an aggregation plot? Which tool do we use to generate one? Which input data 
do we need? Have a look at the aggregation plot done during the hands-on. Are the plots consistent
between the two tissues? Is this what you would expect, given the relationship between H3K4me3 
and gene expression? Why is it important to know the approximate location of a specific histone 
mark with respect to the gene?

Aggregation plots are useful to represent and study the distribution of continuous data like for 
example ChIP-seq signal versus a set of genolmic coordinates. 

We will use an R wrapper that will produce the plot with our input data. As input we will need 
the bigWig files and a gencode annotation with the genomic coordinates. 

Yes, both aggregation plots are very similar in both tissues, as expected becasue they both share
an enrichment in H3K4me3 around the TSS. H3K4me3 is reported to be associated with active transcription 
and we find this mark is enriched around the TSS of the most expressed genes in both tissues.

It is important because if we know the approximate location, we can restrict the signal and asses its 
function. Also we will be able to plot it and make comparisons that would be impossible if we dont know 
where the marks are located in relation to the gene.

10. What type of plot are we using to visualize the correlation between two variables?
Have a look at the plots generated during the hands-on to assess the correlation
between expression and H3K4me3
Are these results consistent between the two tissues?
Would you expect this degree of correlation? Formulate an interpretation of the results

We use a scatterplot with expression H3K4me3 FC.

Yes, they are similar in both tissues having the same shape, Spearman's and Pearson's correlations.

We spected more correlation between both variables due the theorical reltation studied between histon
marks and active transcription. There can be different reason, for example the fact that gene expression
does not depend only in histone marks. There are more gene regulatory mechanism.

11.During the hands-on session, we have checked the level of expression of genes with 
tissue-specific H3K4me3 marking.
Are these results consistent with the degree of correlation we have observed in point8?
Do you observe any unexpected behavior?
How would you relate the presence of genes with tissue-specific marking with the GO
terms obtained?

Yes, they are consistent. 

The only strange behaviour is that in stomach specific marking we don't see a good correlation
of H3K4me3 mark in promoters and higher gene expression levels than this obtained in the 
sigmoid colon specific marking. Also we see that there issome gene expression in stomach 
when analysing sigmoid colon specific marking.
In stomach we can see many enriched genes relationed with immune system,, as well as normal functions of the 
digestive system. In sigmoid colon enrichment we can see less less GO terms enriched. Three of this results
are related with the nervous system. We need to remember that gastrointestinal tract has a high neuronal
density.

12. Have a look at the Venn diagram generated in the last task.
Comment on the number of peaks shared: is there more sharing between peaks of different
type in the same tissue (e.g.H3K4me3 & POLR2A of stomach), or between peaks of the same
type in different tissues (e.g.H3K4me3 of stomach and sigmoid colon)?

We have more sharing of peaks from H3K4me3 shared between tissues. Stomach and sigmoid 
colon H3K4me3 share 5359 peaks while stomach H3K4me3 and POLR2A share only 36. We also
can see that between tissues POLR2A only share 4 peaks. Finally we can focus on the big
number of peaks between the mark H3K4me3 and POLR2A in both tissues (5839) which could be 
interpreted as a high correlation between this two types of marks.
